### The basics
credit card vs debit card
- credit is like a mini loan every time you use it.
- every use of the credit card charges a merchant fee, like 2-3%
- the credit card company makes a small margin of profit for each use, and passes most of the profit to the user as rewards.

always spend within your means. Do not overspend, and never put the cost on future you.

never cancel a credit card. this removes the age of the credit card, which decreases your credit score. It is much better to downgrade to a no yearly fee card, and just never use it.

Don't fake your purchase spending like buying gift cards, credit companies are really good at finding this stuff.


## the journey

### starter cards
using your credit card is like gaining XP and leveling up. As you go, you level up and gain access to higher level, better credit cards. 

The best way to level up is to play the game properly. you start with the entry level, default cards, then to beginner, intermediate, and advanced. 

Secured credit cards:
- you give the bank your own money and that is used as your credit limit. this is generally for people with really bad credit scores.

credit builder card:
- similar to secured card, the "down payment" on that card is a checking account with the same card issuer. This means great way to build credit fast and become eligiable for better cards.

student card
- lower credit limits
- geared to students
- very straight forward
