This one is a step up more complicated. Darkweb is a monitoring service that watched information leaks for email addresses and passwords and other things (probably). 

Here's the thought process:
When records get compromised, chances are they are previously used records for past employees. So, you can check admin panel or MS Entra to see the status of the emails. 

If the email is out of service, disregard the ticket and mark it as closed. 

Else, notify the POC immediately. this is an important breach and the user should change their password immediately.
