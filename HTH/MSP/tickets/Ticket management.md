There are many ways to go about managing and completing tickets. Here are some core concepts:

1. understanding what the client is asking:
	- A lot of the time, client's knowledge of computer systems can be very low. This means they may ask you for extremely simple tasks, like deleting a folder. Try not to overthink what they are asking, and always be respectful.
	- Never ask a client to do anything. They pay for our service, so if they ask you to do something for them, its better to complete it yourself instead of giving them instructions on how to do it. 
	- Dont be afraid to use chatgpt
2. identifying the process
	- seeing what you will need to access is important for figuring out what you need to do.
	- Microsoft/O365
		- many client tickets will stem from here
		- you will frequently access microsoft Entra for admin work. Entra is a higher-level operator for admin control panel.
