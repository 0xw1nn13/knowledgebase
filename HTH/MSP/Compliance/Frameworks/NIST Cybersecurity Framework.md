The Cyber Security Framework (CSF) is not meant to be a one size fits all. This is because it is a set of guidelines how to operate securely. All businesses, sectors, and operations will have varying levels of risks and tolerances, as well as special/unique circumstances.

CSF is used to address risks alongside other business practices, such as finances, supply chain, reputation, and technological.

Framework overview;
CSF Core:
- the heart of the CSF. This includes all the high-level security practices and outcomes. The core components are a hierarchy of functions, categories, and subcategories that detail each outcome.
- The CSF core consists of outcomes that are sector-neutral. This means they are goals that can be followed by any organization regardless of industry or service. 

CSF Organizational Profiles:
- the mechanism for describing an organizations' current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF core. 

CSF Tiers:
- This can be applied to CSF Organizational Profiles to characterize the rigor the company wishes to pursue. This describes how significant the steps taken are. An organization may only desire a small change over a long period of time, while some may want an immediate complete restructure of their cyber security posture. 

CSF describes what what outcomes should/could be achieved, it does NOT prescribe them. 



Descriptions of HOW an organization can achieve their goals can be found on https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework
