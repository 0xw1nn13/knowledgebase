Cyber compliance is generally pretty complicated. It changes sector to sector, as different feilds require different levels of security and scrutiny.

There are different ways to handle compliance, with the most well accepted being the CIA triad, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Key aspects of compliance: 
1. Regulatory frameworks and standards:
	1. NIST framework - provides cybersecurity guidelines for US companies
	2. ISO/IEC 27001 - International standard for information security management
	3. PCI DSS - credit card and payment security framework
	4. HIPPA - (important for msp) Medical information privacy
2. Risk management and assesments 
	- Regular evaluations of security posture for companies' security risks, vulnerabilities, and threats
3. Policies and procedures 
	- Organizations must implement security policies such as access controls, encryption standards, and incident response plans
4. Security controls and best practices-
	- Deploying firewalls, IDS, MFA, encryption, and other standards to safely protect your business ecosystem
5. Employee training and awareness
	- ensuring staff are properly trained and aware of security measures and why they are implemented. 
6. continuous monitoring and audits
	- Regularly reviewing and updating security measures to maintain compliance and respond to  evolving cyber threats.
